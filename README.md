# CliMovieProject

This gem acts as a movie queue. You can find out more information about your selected film, and then add it to a watchlist for later. The program will show you information of a movie based on a user inputed title. 


## Usage

You must first input your API Key as instructed in './bin/movie_project'. Then, run 'bundle install' to install any required dependencies. Lastly, you can run the './bin/movie_project' file in order to begin the program.
